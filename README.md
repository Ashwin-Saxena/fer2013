# FER2013
Kaggle Challenge - https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

Facial Emotion Recognition on FER2013 Dataset Using a Convolutional Neural Network with 66.369% accuracy.

Winner - 71.161% accuracy

## Getting Started

These instructions will get this model up and running. Follow them to make use of the `fertestcusstom.py` file to recognize facial emotions using custom images. This model can also be used as facial emotion recognition part of projects with broader applications

### Prerequisites
Tensorflow
Keras
NumPy
sklearn
Pandas
OpenCV
```
 pip3 install tensorflow
 pip3 install keras
 pip3 install numpy
 pip3 install sklearn
 pip3 install pandas
 pip3 install opencv-python
```
### Installing
Clone this repository using-
```
git clone https://github.com/gitshanks/fer2013.git
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
